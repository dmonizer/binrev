# BinRev

A web based tool to analyse and help reverse engineering of (un)known binary formats.

## History

This project came to be as a result of the need to analyze and reverse engineer binary formats, particularly in the context of security research. It is designed to provide a user-friendly interface for examining binary files, extracting information, understanding their structure and providing a machine readable description (project json) for further tools usage.

It started as a test project for [Bolt.new](https://bolt.new/) AI coding assistant but has since evolved into a fairly full-fledged tool with the help of multiple different AI ([Cline](https://github.com/cline/cline), [Kilocode](https://kilocode.ai/), [Copilot](https://github.com/features/copilot), [Gemini CLI](https://blog.google/technology/developers/introducing-gemini-cli-open-source-ai-agent/) and [ChatGPT](https://chatgpt.com/)) agents working in concert for about 5 days. At the moment of first public release, human written code was maybe 5-10% overall.
